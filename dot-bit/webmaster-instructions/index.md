Interested in operating a Dot-Bit website? Awesome, you're in the right place.

### DyName

DyName is a dynamic DNS update client for Dot-Bit. It is useful if your host can switch IP addresses without warning.

Dynamic DNS is typically risky for Dot-Bit, since the decrypted keys to transfer your domain are located on an Internet-connected server.  It is therefore a good idea to use DyName in combination with [delegated alteration]({{site.baseurl}}docs/name-owners/delegated-alteration).

To obtain DyName, [visit the GitHub project.](https://github.com/JeremyRand/DyName)
