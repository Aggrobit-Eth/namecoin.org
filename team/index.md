## Anonymous Developers

We have several developers who prefer to remain anonymous; their anonymity does not reflect the incredible impact their contributions have made to Namecoin. We are deeply grateful for their work.

# Former Developers

We have several developers who are no longer active in the community, listed below.

## Mikhail Sindeyev (thecoder)

Mikhail (then acting under a pseudonym) was our lead C++ developer for roughly a year (prior to Daniel), working on namecoind and creating Namecoin-Qt. Mikhail was a PhD student at Moscow State University. In 2014 Mikhail tragically died of a stroke at the age of 29. His identity was made public shortly after his death so that his great contribution to free speech technology would be recognized.

## Khalahan Henkh (khal)

Khalahan (a pseudonym) was our lead C++ developer for roughly two years (prior to Mikhail), working on namecoind and creating NMControl. Khalahan is currently retired.

## Vincent Durham (vinced)

Vincent (a pseudonym) was the creator of Namecoin, forking Bitcoin’s code to create the first solution to Zooko’s Triangle. Vincent is currently retired.
