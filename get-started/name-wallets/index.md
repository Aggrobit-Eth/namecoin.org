To register a Namecoin name, you need a Namecoin wallet that supports name operations.  Currently, that means you want Namecoin Core.  Namecoin Core includes both a Qt GUI (Namecoin-Qt) and a command-line version (namecoind).  You can download Namecoin Core at the [Downloads]({{site.baseurl}}download/) page.

After you've installed Namecoin Core, you'll need to [obtain some NMC]({{site.baseurl}}get-started/get-namecoins) (the digital currency used by Namecoin).
