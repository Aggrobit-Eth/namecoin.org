Namecoin developer Jeremy Rand will attend [Decentralized Web Summit 2018](https://decentralizedweb.net/) in San Francisco, July 31 - August 2, hosted by the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).  Namecoin will be at the [Science Fair](https://decentralizedwebsummit2018.sched.com/event/FMJT/science-fair) and will give a Lightning Talk (schedule TBA).  We're also open to meetups and hacking sessions independent of the official DWS schedule, so if you're attending DWS (or if you're in the SF area) and would like to chat or hack, get in touch with us!  We're looking forward to the Summit!
