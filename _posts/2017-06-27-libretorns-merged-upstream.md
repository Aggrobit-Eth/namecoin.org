title: LibreTorNS Merged to Upstream TorNS

meejah has merged the LibreTorNS patches to [upstream TorNS](https://github.com/meejah/torns).  That means LibreTorNS is now obsolete, and you should use meejah's upstream TorNS for testing dns-prop279 going forward.

Huge thanks to meejah for accepting the patch (and for the code review)!
