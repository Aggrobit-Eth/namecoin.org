Christmas has come early for Namecoin: Discus Fish (aka F2Pool) has donated 20,000 namecoins to fund a reimplementation based on mainline Bitcoin!

What’s more is that chief Namecoin scientist Daniel Kraft has been working so hard that the code is already usable! Indeed, Discus Fish has been using it in production for a few weeks. The code is still considered experimental but you can check it out on [Daniel’s Github repo](https://github.com/domob1812/namecore). As always, make encrypted backups before playing around.

TL;DR: Namecoin is back!
