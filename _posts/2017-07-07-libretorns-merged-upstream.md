title: LibreTorNS Merged to Upstream TorNS

Generally I'm of the opinion that it's better to get patches to other people's projects merged upstream whenever feasible; accordingly I submitted the LibreTorNS patches upstream.  Happily, meejah has merged the LibreTorNS patches to [upstream TorNS](https://github.com/meejah/torns).  That means LibreTorNS is now obsolete, and you should use meejah's upstream TorNS for testing dns-prop279 going forward.

Huge thanks to meejah for accepting the patch!  Also thanks to meejah for the code review -- there was a bug hiding in my initial submitted patch, which is one of the reasons I always prefer getting things reviewed by upstream.
