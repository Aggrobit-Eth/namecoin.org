As a result of an invitation from Riccardo Spagni (AKA fluffypony of [Monero](https://getmonero.org/)), I will be speaking at the "Practical Cryptography & Blockchains: Beyond the Hype" track at [QCon London 2017](https://qconlondon.com/) (March 6-8 2017).  My talk is entitled "Case Study: Alternate Blockchains".  I will also be on a panel discussion alongside Paul Sztorc, David Vorick, Elaine Ou, Peter Todd, and Riccardo Spagni.

My understanding is that a video of my talk will be published by QCon.  Assuming that that's correct, I will post a link here when it's available.

Huge thanks to Riccardo for inviting me, and to the QCon organizers for putting on the conference and covering my travel expenses.  Looking forward to it!
