Fix for OpenSSL Consensus Vulnerability has been deployed on 100% of mining hashpower.  Users of NamecoinQ (i.e. namecoind/Namecoin-Qt 0.3.x) are on semi-SPV security, and should wait for at least 6 confirmations for incoming transactions.  Users of Namecoin Core (in beta) are on full-node security.  Thanks to the miners for their quick action and everyone else who assisted in the response.
