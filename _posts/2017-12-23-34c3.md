Namecoin developers Jeremy Rand and Jonas Ostman will attend [34C3 (the 34th Chaos Communication Congress)](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) in Leipzig, December 27-30.  There's a good chance that the 34C3 Monero Assembly will host some Namecoin talks.  We're looking forward to the congress!
