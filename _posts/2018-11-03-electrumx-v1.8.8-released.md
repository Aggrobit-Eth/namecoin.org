[Upstream ElectrumX](https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx) has released v1.8.8, which includes [name script support]({{site.baseurl}}2018/10/25/electrumx-name-scripts-merged.html).  If you run a Namecoin ElectrumX server, please consider upgrading to the latest ElectrumX release.

(And a reminder that we need more ElectrumX instances... please consider running one if you have a server with spare resources!)

This work was funded by Cyphrs and NLnet Foundation's Internet Hardening Fund.
