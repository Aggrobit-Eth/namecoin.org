**Namecoin** is an experimental open-source technology which improves decentralization, security, censorship resistance, privacy, and speed of certain Internet technologies such as DNS and identities.

(For the technically minded, Namecoin is a key/value pair registration and transfer system based on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.)

*Bitcoin frees money â€“ Namecoin frees DNS, identities, and other technologies.*

## What can Namecoin be used for?

* Protect free-speech rights online by making the web more resistant to censorship.
* Access websites using the .bit top-level domain.
* Decentralized TLS (HTTPS) certificate validation, backed by blockchain consensus.
* Human-meaningful Tor .onion domains.
* Attach identity information such as GPG and OTR keys and email, Bitcoin, and Bitmessage addresses to an identity of your choice.
* Proposed ideas such as file signatures, voting, bonds/stocks/shares, web of trust, notary services, and proof of existence. (To be implemented.)

What does Namecoin do under the hood?
-------------------------------------

* Securely record and transfer arbitrary names (keys).
* Attach a value (data) to the names (up to 520 bytes).
* Transact the digital currency namecoins (NMC).
* Like bitcoins, Namecoin names are difficult to censor or seize.
* Lookups do not generate network traffic (improves privacy).

**Namecoin** was the first fork of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org) and still is one of the most innovative "altcoins".  It was first to implement [merged mining](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/273/how-does-merged-mining-work) and a [decentralized DNS](https://bit.namecoin.info).  **Namecoin** was also the first solution to [Zooko's Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle), the long-standing problem of producing a naming system that is simultaneously secure, decentralized, and human-meaningful.
